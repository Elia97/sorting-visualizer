# Sorting Visualizer

An interactive application that allows you to visualize sorting algorithms in real-time.

## ðŸ“‹ Description

This project is a sorting algorithm visualizer built with React that enables you to:

- Observe how different sorting algorithms work in real-time
- Compare the performance and characteristics of each algorithm
- Intuitively understand how algorithms work through visual representation

Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science, and this application provides an intuitive way to see how each algorithm manipulates an array of data through animations.

## ðŸ§© Implemented Algorithms

The application includes the following sorting algorithms:

- Selection Sort: Finds the minimum value and places it at the beginning of the unsorted array
- Insertion Sort: Builds a sorted array one element at a time
- Bubble Sort: Compares adjacent pairs of elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order
- Quick Sort: Uses the "divide and conquer" approach with a pivot element
- Heap Sort: Uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements
